## üéØ Exploratory Goals 

- **Data Cleaning**  
  - Handle missing values and drop irrelevant columns.
  - Format datetime fields and convert data types for memory efficiency.

- **Aggregation Strategy**  
  - Group by `trip_uuid` to merge segment rows into trip-level summaries using:
    - `sum()` for time/distance
    - `first()` or `last()` for non-aggregatable fields

- **Feature Engineering**  
  - Extract `month`, `year`, `hour` from `trip_creation_time`
  - Derive `trip_duration` from `od_end_time - od_start_time`
  - Parse `source_name` and `destination_name` into city and state

- **Hypothesis Testing**  
  - Compare **OSRM vs actual** metrics (time, distance)
  - Compare **segment-level** vs **trip-level metrics**
  - Use t-tests, Levene‚Äôs test, and visual analysis

- **Outlier Detection**  
  - Use **IQR** method to detect and clip **extreme values**

- **Encoding & Scaling**  
  - One-hot encode `route_type`
  - Normalize numerical features using MinMaxScaler

## üí° Business Insights

1. **Significant delay** observed in actual delivery times vs OSRM estimates.
2. **Mumbai dominates** as both source and destination ‚Äî optimize routes here.
3. **Segment-wise metrics provide more realistic insight** than OSRM predictions alone.
4. Discrepancies in distance and time point to **routing inefficiencies**.
5. **Route type** (FTL vs Carting) can influence variance ‚Äî ideal for modeling.
6. Delivery demand is heavily concentrated in **5 major states**‚Äîstrong infrastructure focus needed here.


## ‚úÖ Recommendations

1. **Enhance OSRM Accuracy**  
   Improve OSRM engine by integrating real-time traffic, seasonal trends, road conditions, and terrain data to reduce prediction discrepancies.

2. **Route Compliance Monitoring**  
   Track deviations between planned (OSRM) and actual routes using GPS data to minimize inefficiencies and delays.

3. **Optimize High-Traffic Corridors**  
   Prioritize infrastructure, staffing, and delivery resources in top-performing regions like **Mumbai, Bengaluru, Gurgaon, Maharashtra, and Karnataka**.

4. **Customer Profiling & Demand Forecasting**  
   Leverage regional behavioral patterns and engineered features (e.g., trip hour, route type) in machine learning models to better predict demand.

5. **Technology Integration**  
   Adopt advanced systems for **real-time route optimization**, **predictive ETAs**, and proactive delivery adjustments during high-demand periods.

6. **Outlier Detection & Process Monitoring**  
   Use IQR-based thresholds to identify and manage performance anomalies for continuous operational improvement.

7. **Continuous Improvement Culture**  
   Establish data-driven feedback loops from logistics data and customer input to refine processes and elevate service quality.
